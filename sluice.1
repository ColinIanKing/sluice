.SH NAME
sluice \- a tool to measure system events.
.br

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sluice
.RI [options]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
sluice is a program that reads input on stdin and outputs on stdout at
a specified data rate.

.SH OPTIONS
sluice options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-h
show help
.TP
.B \-m size
specify amount of data to process, the default size is in bytes, but the K, M and G suffixes
can specify size in Kbytes, Mbytes and Gbytes respectively.
.TP
.B \-i size
specify the read/write size, the default size is in bytes, but the K, M and G suffixes
can specify size in Kbytes, Mbytes and Gbytes respectively.
.TP
.B \-r rate
specify the data rate in bytes per second. The K, M and G suffixes
can specify the rate in Kbytes/sec, Mbytes/sec and Gbytes/sec respectively.
.TP
.B \-u
detect underflow and re-size read/write buffer size to try and stop underflows. This will
expand the buffer each time 10 consecutive underflows are detected. The buffer will not
be expanded any more than 4MB in size.
.TP
.B \-v 
write verbose statistics to stderr
.TP
.B \-w 
warn if a long burst of continuous data rate underflow occurs, the warning is issued just once.  To overcome the underflow increase the \-i read/write buffer size or use the \-u option to auto-expand the read/write buffer.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Read /dev/zero and write in 4K sizes at the rate of 1MB/sec to the file example.dat
.RS 8
cat /dev/zero | sluice \-i 4K \-r 1M > example.dat
.RE
.LP
Read 32MB from /dev/zero and write at the rate of 64K/sec to stdout with feedback on stderr 
.RS 8
cat /dev/zero | sluice \-r 64K \-v \-m 32M
